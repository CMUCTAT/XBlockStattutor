# StatTutor problem files
Each subdirectory of this directory represents a individual StatTutor
problem.

Each subdirectory should contain only one .xml description file and
one .brd tutor file.
Relative links in the files in these directories should be relative to
stattutor/public/ in order to follow the OLI directory structure
conventions.

New problems from OLI should be added here and should need no
modification as long as the single .brd and single .xml file
restriction is observed.
