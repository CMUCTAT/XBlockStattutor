%(our_design_sampling)%			The patients that were recruited to this study all had at least one prior episode of depression and volunteered to participate in the study by signing a consent form.	"The 312 students who participated in the study were chosen via cluster sampling, where 4 clusters of students were chosen at random, and all the students in these four clusters are the sample. The resulting sample can be considered to be a random sample of the entire ""population"" of students who take the statistics course at this university."	To insure proper representation, the instructor randomly chose 35 students from each section he taught that semester.  This is an example of stratified sampling.	We are not given any information about how the 189 women were chosen to participate in the study, except the fact that they were all treated at the Baystate Medical Center.	The 50 drivers in this study were selected randomly from drivers insured at an unnamed insurance company.
%(our_design_thought)%			"&lt;img src=""depression_consider_study_design_thought_question_statcrunch.jpg""&gt; &lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt; We see in the output that the randomization was effective in assigning roughly the same number of patients to each of the three treatment groups (37, 38, and 34).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt; The side-by-side boxplots reveal that the distributions of the variable AcuteT within each of the three treatment groups are very similar. All have a median of roughly 170, and no unusual or systematic differences in spread.  Thus, the randomization was effective in balancing AcuteT among the three treatment groups."				
%(our_q1consider)%	Answers here can vary quite a bit. It would be reasonable to predict that typically, students have no more than 5 alcoholic drinks in a week.	Typically, students who perform well in high school (as measured by a high GPA) will also tend to perform well in college (also measured by a high GPA). Therefore, one could expect that the data will show a similar trend.	The results can be used by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) to make an informed decision about the usage and safety of medicines.	Since students from a variety of majors are required to take a statistics course, there is no reason to believe that the students who participated in this study have different verbal skills (as measured by verbal SAT scores) than the general population at this university.	It would be reasonable to expect that students who did the extra credit assignment did better on the final than those who didn't do the extra credit assignment.	Smoking is known to be a risk factor, and therefore it would be reasonable to expect the data will show that smoking has a significant effect on the occurrence of low birth weight infants.	In general, one's driving ability improves with driving experience.  Therefore, we expect the results of the study will show that the monthly premium will decrease as driving experience increases.

%(our_q1conclusions)%	Typically, students drink about one drink a week, with 50% of the students drinking one or fewer and 50% drinking one or more. A closer look at the data reveals that drinking is a problem in this university. More specifically, Q3 = 7.25 which means that 25% of the students consume more than 7 alcoholic beverages a week, which is quite a serious problem.	The results indicate that in general the students who have a higher high school GPA will tend to also have a higher college GPA, and vice versa. The results further indicate that this relationship is linear and that it is moderately strong.	The results clearly reveal that Imipramine is by far more effective than Lithium in preventing the recurrence of depression. 62.16% of the patients taking Lithium had a recurrence of depression which is more than twice that of patients who took Imipramine (28.95%). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results also question the effectiveness of Lithium in general since the percentage of patients who had a recurrence of depression in the Placebo group (67.65%) is only slightly higher than that of the Lithium group (62.16%).	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the exploratory analysis we found that the mean verbal SAT score in the sample of stat students is 597, which is quite different from 580.  The question is:  Are the results significantly different from 580?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indeed, the formal statistical test produced a p-value of .011, indicating that the data provide sufficient evidence to reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and to conclude that the mean verbal SAT score of stat students is significantly different than 580, the mean score for the entire student body in this university.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory analysis revealed differences in performance on the final between students who turned in the extra credit assignment and those who didn't. More specifically, the students who turned in the extra credit generally scored higher on the final.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formal statistical test produced a very small p-value (essentially 0), indicating that the evidence provided by the data is strong enough to reject Ho and conclude that the performance on the final of students who did not do the extra credit assignment is significantly worse than the performance of the students who did do the extra credit assignment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory analysis revealed that low birth weight babies are more prevalent among mothers who smoke during pregnancy than among mothers who don't (40.54 vs. 25.22%).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formal statistical test produced a p-value of .026 indicating that the data provide enough evidence to conclude that low birth weight is significantly related to smoking.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory data analysis suggests that as the driving experience increases the monthly premium decreases and that this negative relationship is moderately linear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the p-value of the test is so small that it is reported to be essentially 0, we can conclude that these results are significant and that, indeed, there is a (moderate) linear relationship between monthly premium and driving experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
%(our_q1conclusions_thought)%	Some possible information to consider:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The age of the students: Are they legally able to drink?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What days of the week are students drinking and how is the drinking spread out over the week?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Are students missing class, coming to class drunk, driving drunk, etc.?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	"&lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt; The regression equation is given in the following output: &lt;img src=""body_image_q1_consider_results_thought_question_statcrunch.jpg""&gt; &lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt; The graph displays a pretty good fit of the regression line to the data.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(c)&lt;/b&gt; The predicted GPA for a student whose HS GPA is 3.45 is: 1.073 + 0.6192 * 3.45 = 3.21."		"&lt;img src=""cell_phones_q1_consider_results_thought_question_statcrunch.jpg""&gt; The 95% confidence interval for the mean verbal SAT score of stat students at this university is roughly (584, 610). We are therefore 95% confident that the mean verbal SAT score of stat students at this university is between 584 and 610.  Note that the entire confidence interval (representing the plausible values for the mean verbal SAT score of stats students at this university) does not include 580, which is consistent with the fact that the H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; was rejected."	No! Since this is an observational study, no causal conclusions can be made (recall that the only case where association implies causation is when the study is a randomized experiment). A possible explanation for the difference in the two groups of students is that the more conscientious students will usually do extra credit work and will also tend to do well on the final.		For each additional year of driving experience, the monthly premium decreases, on average by $1.45.
%(our_q1reflect)%	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Most of the students had fewer drinks/week than we thought, but many drank far more than we predicted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the results suggest that drinking is a problem at this university and it may be affecting students' health, safety, or academic performance, the administration should consider what actions need to be taken to solve the problem.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are consistent with what can be expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;We should intervene and counsel students while still in high school. Knowing that students with low GPAs are at risk of not doing well in college, colleges should develop programs, such as peer or faculty mentors, for these students.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since it is impossible for us to know which drug is better before conducting the experiment, we did not make a prediction for this question.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;These kind of results could definitely lead to some change in FDA policy, because one of the drugs was more effective than the other.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are different from what we had originally expected. A possible explanation is that students who are required to take this stat class are from certain majors which are more competitive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;These results might be useful to the university for future admission purposes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are consistent with what we expected before analyzing the data.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The instructor can communicate these results to students in future semesters, but should caution them that doing the extra credit does not insure success in the course.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are not surprising. They are consistent with what we expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The risks associated with smoking, specifically smoking during pregnancy, should be communicated to pregnant women in as many ways as possible (including pamphlets, Internet, prenatal caregivers, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are consistent with what we expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have seen that insurance companies use experience as a factor in deciding insurance premiums, but there is no practical use for this information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
%(our_q2consider)%	"Most universities do not have an ""honor code,"" so it would make sense to expect that most students answered that they would not report on cheating."	There is no right or wrong answer here. In the past, body image was a problem associated mostly with females. These days, however, this is no longer the case.	Given the results of the first question, we can expect that Imipramine would be the most effective drug in delaying the recurrence of depression.	There is no reason to believe that students at this university are different from the entire population of students in the U.S. with respect to whether or not they own a cell phone.	Since the material covered by the second exam is harder, it would be reasonable to expect that students' scores were generally lower.	It would be reasonable to expect some differences between races in the occurrence of low birth weight babies. It would be interesting to see whether the data provide enough evidence to conclude that race is indeed a risk factor.	In general, it is common knowledge that male drivers have higher premiums than female drivers. It can therefore be expected that the results of this study will be consistent with that.

%(our_q2conclusions)%	Since the vast majority would not report on cheating, it is most likely that if there was cheating going on during an exam, the instructor would not know about it. On the other hand, even if one of the 8.5% of students who answered that they would report on cheating witnessed it, then the instructor would be informed.	The results indicate that males and females do differ with respect to their body image. A larger proportion of females felt that their weight was about right (roughly 74% vs. 67% for males). Among the students who did not feel that their weight was about right, there was a difference between males and females. Roughly the same proportion of male students were concerned about being overweight as being underweight (18% vs. 15.5%), while females were mostly concerned about being overweight (22% vs. only 4% for underweight).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is interesting to find that actually a larger proportion of males are concerned with their body image compared to females. Also, it makes sense that being underweight is more of a concern for males than it is for females because of the current quest of many males for a big, muscular body and the quest for females to emulate thin fashion models.	"The results show that overall, Imipramine is more effective in delaying the recurrence of depression compared to Lithium. It should be noted, however, that the large spread in the distribution of the variable ""Time"" among patients who were treated with Imipramine indicates that being treated with this drug does not guarantee a long delay in the recurrence of depression. In addition, the similarity in the distribution of time until recurrence of depression between the Lithium and Placebo groups suggests that Lithium may not really be an effective treatment for depression."	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the exploratory analysis we found that roughly 78% of the sampled students own a cell phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formal statistical test assessed that even though 78% is less than 80%, this does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the proportion of students at this university who own a cell phone is less than .8 (which is the national proportion).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though the material covered by the second exam is harder, the exploratory analysis does not provide any evidence indicating that students performed worse on the second exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;More formally, the paired t-test produced a p-value of .203 indicating that the data do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude that students did better on the first exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the exploratory data analysis, we saw some differences in the occurrence of low birth weight babies among mothers of different races.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formal statistical test, however, produced a p-value of .082 indicating that the data do not provide enough evidence to conclude that low birth weight is indeed related to race.  In other words, even though the data showed some differences between the races, the evidence in not strong enough to conclude that race is a risk factor for low birth weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory data analysis suggests that the premiums of male drivers are higher than the premiums of female drivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the p-value of the two-sample t-test is small (in particular, it is &amp;lt; .05) we can conclude that the data provide significant evidence that the mean monthly premium of males is higher than that of females.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

%(our_q2reflect)%	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results we got are consistent with what we predicted that they would be.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The instructor might want to reconsider using the honor code and should definitely be on the lookout for cheating herself/himself.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As we expected, both males and females have issues with body image.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;It would be useful to report these results to people who counsel students, since concerns about body image can result in poor college performance and health issues.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results we got are consistent with what we found in the first question. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;Imipramine is superior to Lithium as a treatment for depression so doctors should consider prescribing it instead of Lithium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are consistent with what we initially expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;We found no relevant or meaningful way to use this information for a practical purpose.  It is merely interesting information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are quite surprising.  One explanation could be that in order to compensate for the fact that the material covered by the second exam is harder, the students spent more time studying for the exam, and therefore this is not reflected by the students' grades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students need to know ahead of time that the material on the second exam is more challenging so they can plan their study time accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Interesting results. It was actually surprising that the formal analysis did not find a significant race effect.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since we found no association between race and low birth weight, there is no practical use for this information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are consistent with what we expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have seen that insurance companies use gender as a factor in deciding insurance premiums, but there is no practical use for this information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
%(our_q3consider)%		One would expect that generally, students who sit in the front or middle of the classroom are the more conscientious students and therefore are also students with higher GPAs. This is of course, a gross generalization. It will be interesting to see whether the data will support this.		It would be reasonable to expect that the mean number of sleep hours of students will be lower due to studying or partying…	It would be reasonable to expect that there will be differences between the classes. More specifically, freshmen might score slightly lower due to time management adjustments, and seniors might score slightly lower due to an attitude of 'I just want to pass and graduate.'	It is known that age is a risk factor for complications during pregnancy, where the older the mother, the more likely the occurrence. It would be reasonable to expect that the data will support that low birth weight may be one of the issues for older mothers.

%(our_q3conclusions)%		The data suggest that GPA is somewhat related to seating location. In general, the GPAs of students who sit in the front of the classroom are slightly higher than those of students who sit in the middle or in the back. However, there is a lot of variation in GPA within each of the three groups, and therefore the student's typical seating location should not really be used as an indication of his/her performance in college.		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mean number sleep hours in our sample was found to be roughly 7.2, which is slightly higher than the national average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formal statistical test produced a p-value of .017 indicating that this sample result provides enough evidence to reject Ho and conclude that the mean number of sleep hours of stat students is significantly different from the national mean for U.S. adults, which is 7 hours of sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory analysis suggested that there are differences in performance on the final between students in the different classes. In particular, the data suggests that in general, seniors scored lower, and more specifically, substantially lower than juniors.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Formally, the ANOVA F-test indeed produces a p-value of .042 indicating that the data provide enough evidence to reject Ho and conclude that there are significant differences in performance on the final between students in the different class groups.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory data analysis revealed some small differences in age between mothers who had an occurrence of a low birth weight baby and mothers who didn't.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indeed, the formal statistical test produced a p-value of .078 indicating that the data do not provide enough evidence to conclude that there are differences in age between the two groups of mothers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

We are therefore 95% confident that the mean number of sleep hours of stat students at this university is between 7.04 and 7.35.  Note that the entire confidence interval (representing the plausible values for the mean number of sleep hours of stats students at this university) does not include 7, which is consistent with the fact that Ho was rejected."			
%(our_q3reflect)%		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The conclusions support what we would naturally expect. It was interesting to find hardly any differences in GPAs between students who sit in the middle of the classroom and those who sit in the back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If instructors were made aware of these results, they could encourage students who are doing poorly to change their seat location. Also, students should be made aware that where they sit might impact their performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;		&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are actually very different from what we initially expected. Interesting...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since many stats students are teenagers and teenagers need more sleep than adults, students should be advised to make sure they are getting enough sleep to be able to do their best at the university.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are consistent with what we expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;The instructor could monitor the progress of freshman more closely and counsel students as needed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;These are interesting results. Completely opposite of what we thought...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although age does not appear to be a factor for low birth weight babies, this does not rule out the possibility of other complications for pregnancies at an older or at very young ages.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	
%(our_Summary)%	We considered two aspects of student life.  The social aspect of drinking and the more academic aspect of cheating.  We are concerned about some students drinking too much and that most students would not report cheating if they saw it.	In the first and third question, we examined two explanatory variables for the response variable college GPA. We found that generally, students who have a high high school GPA will tend to also have a high college GPA, and that students who typically sit in the front of the classroom generally have a higher GPA than those who sit in the middle or the back. In the second question, we investigated a completely unrelated issue, the differences in body image between males and females. We were surprised to find that actually a higher percentage of females were satisfied with their weight than males.	In this exercise we assessed the effectiveness of Lithium and Imipramine as treatments for depression. The two measures of effectiveness were whether or not recurrence of depression occurred, and the time until recurrence of depression. Using both measures we found that Imipramine is more effective than Lithium. More specifically, patients who were treated with Imipramine were less likely to have a recurrence of depression, and if they did, it took longer for recurrence to occur compared to patients who were treated with Lithium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results we found also called into question the effectiveness of Lithium since the patients who were treated with it did not display any substantial differences compared to patients who did not receive any treatment, both in terms of an occurrence of depression, and in terms of the time until a recurrence.	The three questions we answered in this exercise have to do with evaluating some characteristics of stats students at the university where the study was done relative to some other larger groups of students. We found that the mean verbal SAT score of the stats students is significantly different from that of the entire student body at the university, and that the proportion of stats students who own a cell phone is not significantly lower than the proportion for all college students in the nation. In addition we found that the mean number of sleep hours of stats students at this university is significantly different from that of U.S. adults.	In this exercise we analyzed data from an instructor's gradebook.  We found that performance on the final is significantly related to whether or not the student did an extra credit assignment as well as to the student's class.  Also, we were surprised to find out that even though the material covered by the second midterm is harder than the material covered by the first midterm, there were no significant differences in performance between the two exams.	In this exercise we examined potential risk factors for the occurrence of a low birth weight baby. We found that smoking is a significant risk factor, and race has some effect, but the data did not provide strong enough evidence to conclude that it is a risk factor.  We also found that there are no significant differences in age between mothers who had a low birth weight baby and mothers who didn't.	We found that both gender and driving experience are factors in determining the monthly premium of auto insurance. In particular, the monthly premium for males is significantly higher than that for females, and the monthly premium generally decreases as the driver gains more experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be mentioned that there are other factors that affect the monthly premium that were not investigated in this exercise (for example: number of accidents and car model).
%(our_evaluate_validity)%			&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study was a randomized experiment and therefore we can make causal conclusions. In other words, any differences in outcomes between the three groups can be attributed to the different treatments they received rather than any other possible confounding variables. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;Since this study was not about characteristics of depression patients, but rather about comparing different treatments for it, even if the patients who volunteered for this study are not representative of all depression patients, it should not weaken the strength of the results. Thus, we can generalize these results to the population of patients who have experienced depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	"&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The questions in this StatTutor only dealt with one variable rather than how one variable affected another.  Thus, making causal conclusions is not appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cluster sampling design produces a random sample, and therefore we can generalize our results to the entire ""population"" of students at this university who are taking this stats class. Again, since stats students have many different majors, we can probably generalize the results to the entire student body at &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt; university.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;"	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As we discussed before, this is an observational study, so the instructor cannot make any causal conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;We can definitely generalize the results to the entire group of students who take Introductory Statistics with this instructor.  Therefore, the results can be very informative to this instructor.  However,  it is not clear whether the results we got can be generalized to any larger group beyond this instructor's students.  One could argue that the results we get for one instructor could be very different for another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since this is an observational study, we cannot make any causal conclusions.  However, identifying risk factors is an important finding regardless of whether these risk factors have a direct causal effect on low birth weight.  It should be noted that we can never conduct a randomized experiment for factors such as smoking, race, or age.  However, as long as we have a sample that accounts for the diversity in the population, the results are noteworthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though we are not specifically told this is a random sample, this was a major medical study conducted at a major research center. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that our sample accounts for the diversity in the population of pregnant women and the results can be thought of as more general.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since this was an observational study we cannot make any causal conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the sample for this study was random, we certainly can generalize the results to the population of drivers with similar coverage from this insurance company. In addition, there is no reason to believe that the drivers insured by this company are systematically different from the drivers insured by other companies.  Therefore, we would be safe in generalizing these results to all drivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
