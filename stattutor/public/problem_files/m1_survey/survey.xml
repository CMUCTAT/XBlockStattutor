  <background>A student survey was conducted at a major university.
  Data were collected from a random sample of 236 undergraduate
  students, and the information that was collected included
  physical characteristics (such as height and handedness), study
  habits, academic performance and attitudes, and social behaviors.
  In this exercise we will focus on exploring relationships between
  some of those variables. Note that (a) these are
  &lt;b&gt;real&lt;/b&gt; data, and (b) the symbol * in the
  worksheet means that this observation is not available (this is
  known as a 'missing value').</background>

          <hint>In this dataset, each row represents a single
          student, so the first ten rows represent the first ten
          students. Look at the alcohol column and count how many
          of the first ten students consume 15 or more alcoholic
          beverages in a typical week.</hint>
          <hint>If you look at the first ten students (rows) in the
          dataset, you'll see that five of the students reported
          drinking at least 15 alcoholic beverages in a typical
          week. These are students 1, 5, 6, 7 and 8.</hint>

          cheating, it is most likely that if there was cheating
          going on during an exam, the instructor would not know
          about it. On the other hand, even if one of the 8.5% of
          students who answered that they would report on cheating
          witnessed it, then the instructor would be
          informed.</text>

        <text>We considered two aspects of student life. The social
        aspect of drinking and the more academic aspect of
        cheating. We are concerned about some students drinking too
        much and that most students would not report cheating if
        they saw it.</text>
