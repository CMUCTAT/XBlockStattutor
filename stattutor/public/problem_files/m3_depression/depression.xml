  <background>&lt;b&gt;Background:&lt;/b&gt; Clinical depression is
  a recurrent illness requiring treatment and often
  hospitalization. Nearly 50% of people who have an episode of
  major depression will have a recurrence within 2-3 years. Being
  able to prevent the recurrence of depression in people who are at
  risk for the disease would go a long way to alleviate the pain
  and suffering of patients and would also save society many
  thousands of dollars in medical expenses and lost wages due to an
  inability to work.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The
  Study:&lt;/b&gt; During the 1980's the federal government,
  through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), sponsored a
  multi-centered, randomized, controlled, clinical trial to
  evaluate two drugs to prevent the recurrence of depression in
  patients who have had at least one previous episode of the
  illness (Prien et al., &lt;i&gt; Archives of General
  Psychiatry&lt;/i&gt;, 1984). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;The
  Study Design:&lt;/b&gt; The study was multi-centered. There were
  5 medical clinics in major metropolitan areas across the country
  that participated in this trial. Using many clinics enabled the
  investigators to enroll many more patients into the study and
  allowed for more diversity in the patients who participated.
  There were 3 treatment groups. Patients received either
  Imipramine (Imip), Lithium (Li), or a Placebo (Pl) where Imip and
  Li are active drugs. Patients were randomly assigned to one of
  the 3 treatment groups. Like most other medical studies where
  new, unexplored treatments are evaluated, patients chose
  themselves to participate in the study by signing a consent form.
  Patients were followed for 2-4 years to see whether or not they
  had a recurrence of depression. If they did not have a recurrence
  within this time frame, then their treatment was considered a
  Success. If they did have a recurrence, it was considered a
  Failure. The study was double-blinded. A number of additional
  background variables were measured for each patient.</background>

          <hint>In this dataset, each row represents a single
          patient, so the first ten rows represent the first ten
          patients. Look at the "Outcome" column and count how many
          of the first ten patients had a recurrence of depression
          (coded as 1).</hint>
          <hint>If you look at the "Outcome" column, you'll see
          that five of the first ten patients had a recurrence of
          depression (coded as 1). These are patients 1, 4, 6, 8,

        Data --&gt; Sort from the menubar&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In
        the pop-up window, make sure 'Header row' is selected
        towards the bottom of the window, and then under 'Sort by'
        choose 'Treat' and click 'OK'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now that
        the data are sorted, pick an empty cell in your worksheet
        and create a table where the column headers are 'Treatment
        0 (Lithium)', 'Treatment 1 (Imipramine)', and 'Treatment 2
        (Placebo)'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now under each of those
        headers, enter the formula to calculate the statistic
        'count' and the range of data that corresponds to that
        column header. For example, for Treatment 0, you would
        enter '=count([range])' where [range] represents the range
        of cells that have zeroes in the 'Treat'
        column.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(b)&lt;/b&gt;

        Statistics:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;To
        calculate the descriptive statistics, we're going to create
        a table that will list each statistical measure and the
        value for each treatment group.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make
        sure that the data are sorted by 'Treat' as described
        above.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once the data are sorted, pick
        an empty cell in your worksheet and create a table where
        the row headers are 'Q1', 'min', 'Median', 'Max', and 'Q3'
        and the column headers are 'Treatment 0 (Lithium)',
        'Treatment 1 (Imipramine)', and 'Treatment 2
        (Placebo)'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now for each cell in the
        table, enter the formula to calculate the statistic
        represented by the row header and the range of data in the
        'AcuteT' column of your worksheet that corresponds to the
        treatment group in the column header. For example, after
        you sort your worksheet, say that you have the value '0' in
        rows 2-10 of the 'Treat' column - in your table next to
        'Q1' and under 'Treatment 0 (Lithium)', you would enter
        '=quartile(E2:E10, 1)', since column E is the 'AcuteT'
        column, and rows 2-10 correspond to the data for Treatment
        0.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Here are all of the formulas you'll
        need:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q1:
        &lt;/b&gt;'=quartile([range],1)'
        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;min:
        &lt;/b&gt;'=min([range])'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Median:
        &lt;/b&gt;'=median([range])'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Max:
        &lt;/b&gt;'=max([range])'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q3:
        &lt;/b&gt;'=quartile([range],3)'&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Side
        by Side
        Boxplots:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highlight
        the table you just created, including the row and column
        labels, and then select Insert --&gt; Chart from the top
        menubar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When the Chart Wizard window
        opens, select 'Line' under 'Chart Type', and then click
        'Next'. In Step 2, make sure 'Rows' is selected, and then
        click 'Finish'. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;What we have now is a
        line chart, because Excel can't generate boxplots directly,
        but we're going to make boxplots from this line chart.
        &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Right click on any line on the graph
        and choose 'Format Data Series' from the pop-up menu. Then
        select the 'Options' tab and check the boxes next to
        'High-low lines' and 'Up/down bars' and click
        'OK'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Now to get rid of the lines,
        right click on each line in the graph in turn, choose
        'Format Data Series' from the pop-up menu, select the
        'Patterns' tab and select 'None' under 'Line' and then
        click 'OK'.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</question>

        <our_answer>
          <text>The results clearly reveal that Imipramine is by
          far more effective than Lithium in preventing the

          &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results also question the
          effectiveness of Lithium in general since the percentage
          of patients who had a recurrence of depression in the

          effective in delaying the recurrence of depression
          compared to Lithium. It should be noted, however, that
          the large spread in the distribution of the variable
          "Time" among patients who were treated with Imipramine
          indicates that being treated with this drug does not
          guarantee a long delay in the recurrence of depression.
          In addition, the similarity in the distribution of time
          until recurrence of depression between the Lithium and
          Placebo groups suggests that Lithium may not really be an
          effective treatment for depression.</text>

          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results we got are
          consistent with what we found in the first question.
          &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;Imipramine is superior to
          Lithium as a treatment for depression so doctors should
          consider prescribing it instead of
          Lithium.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <text>In this exercise we assessed the effectiveness of
        Lithium and Imipramine as treatments for depression. The
        two measures of effectiveness were whether or not
        recurrence of depression occurred, and the time until
        recurrence of depression. Using both measures we found that
        Imipramine is more effective than Lithium. More
        specifically, patients who were treated with Imipramine
        were less likely to have a recurrence of depression, and if
        they did, it took longer for recurrence to occur compared
        to patients who were treated with
        Lithium.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The results we found also
        called into question the effectiveness of Lithium since the
        patients who were treated with it did not display any
        substantial differences compared to patients who did not
        receive any treatment, both in terms of an occurrence of
        depression, and in terms of the time until a
        recurrence.</text>

        <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This study was a randomized
        experiment and therefore we can make causal conclusions. In
        other words, any differences in outcomes between the three
        groups can be attributed to the different treatments they
        received rather than any other possible confounding
        variables. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;Since this study
        was not about characteristics of depression patients, but
        rather about comparing different treatments for it, even if
        the patients who volunteered for this study are not
        representative of all depression patients, it should not
        weaken the strength of the results. Thus, we can generalize
        these results to the population of patients who have
        experienced depression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>
