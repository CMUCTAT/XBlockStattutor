  <background>College students at a large state university
  completed a survey about their academic and personal life.
  Questions ranged from "How many credits are you registered for
  this semester?" to "Would you define yourself as a vegetarian?"
  Four sections of an introductory statistics course were chosen at
  random from all the sections of introductory statistics courses
  offered at the university in the semester when the survey was
  conducted, and the 312 students who completed the survey were
  students registered in one of the four chosen
  sections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this exercise, we will use a
  subset of variables from the survey and use the collected data to
  answer three questions. Note that (1) these are real data, and
  (2) the symbol * in the worksheet means that this observation is
  not available (this is known as a "missing
  value").</background>

    <text>The mean verbal SAT score of all the students in this

        <our_answer>
          <text>Since students from a variety of majors are
          required to take a statistics course, there is no reason

        whether the verbal SAT scores of stat students differ from
        the scores of students of the entire student body at this

        <our_answer>
          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the exploratory analysis we
          found that the mean verbal SAT score in the sample of
          stat students is 597, which is quite different from 580.
          The question is: Are the results significantly different
          from 580?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Indeed, the
          formal statistical test produced a p-value of .011,
          indicating that the data provide sufficient evidence to
          reject Ho and to conclude that the mean verbal SAT score
          of stat students is significantly different than 580, the
          mean score for the entire student body in this
          university.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <question>What do the results indicate about the mean
        number of sleep hours of stats students relative to the
        national mean of U.S. adults which is 7?</question>
        <our_answer>
          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The mean number sleep hours in
          our sample was found to be roughly 7.2, which is slightly
          higher than the national
          average.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formal
          statistical test produced a p-value of .017 indicating
          that this sample result provides enough evidence to
          reject Ho and conclude that the mean number of sleep
          hours of stat students is significantly different from
          the national mean for U.S. adults, which is 7 hours of
          sleep.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

          different from what we initially expected.
          Interesting...&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since many
          stats students are teenagers and teenagers need more
          sleep than adults, students should be advised to make
          sure they are getting enough sleep to be able to do their
          best at the university.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <text>The three questions we answered in this exercise have
        to do with evaluating some characteristics of stats
        students at the university where the study was done
        relative to some other larger groups of students. We found
        that the mean verbal SAT score of the stats students is
        significantly different from that of the entire student
        body at the university, and that the proportion of stats
        students who own a cell phone is not significantly lower
        than the proportion for all college students in the nation.
        In addition we found that the mean number of sleep hours of
        stats students at this university is significantly
        different from that of U.S. adults.</text>

        <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The questions in this StatTutor
        only dealt with one variable rather than how one variable
        affected another. Thus, making causal conclusions is not
        appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cluster
        sampling design produces a random sample, and therefore we
        can generalize our results to the entire "population" of
        students at this university who are taking this stats
        class. Again, since stats students have many different
        majors, we can probably generalize the results to the
        entire student body at &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt;
        university.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>
