  <background>A student survey was conducted at a major university.
  Data were collected from a random sample of 239 undergraduate
  students, and the information that was collected included
  physical characteristics (such as height, handedness, etc.),
  study habits, academic performance and attitudes, and social
  behaviors. In this exercise, we will focus on exploring
  relationships between some of those variables. Note that the
  symbol * in the worksheet means that this observation is not
  available (this is known as a 'missing
  value').</background>

    <text>Is there a relationship between students' college GPAs
    and their high school GPAs?</text>

      <consider_question>
        <question>Before analyzing the data and discovering the
        relationship between students' high school GPAs and their
        college GPAs, try to predict what the data will show (use
        your own experience and intuition).</question>
        <our_answer>
          <text>Typically, students who perform well in high school
          (as measured by a high GPA) will also tend to perform
          well in college (also measured by a high GPA). Therefore,
          one could expect that the data will show a similar
          trend.</text>

          Instructions to use the regression line for
          predictions&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Method
          1:&lt;/b&gt; (low tech) Write down the a (y-intercept)
          and b (slope) values for the regression line
          (y=a+bx).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To find the predicted
          y-value for any x, simply add the value of a plus the
          value of b times x.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Note: Remember
          order of operations. Multiplication comes before
          addition. If you use your TI, the TI follows the standard
          order of operations. However, it is wrong to
          do:&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;a + b ENTER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;*
          x ENTER&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This will force the addition
          to be performed before the multiplication, which is
          incorrect.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Method
          2:&lt;/b&gt; If you&#226;&#8364;&#8482;ve set Y1 = a +
          bx.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go to a home screen (press
          2ND/QUIT).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Choose Y1
          (VARS/Y-VARS/1:Function/1:Y1).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press
          left parenthesis, the x-value, right
          parenthesis.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;For example, to find the
          predicted y-value when x is
          3.45.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Y1(3.45)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Press
          ENTER &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Based on
          the result you got, answer the following questions in the
          textbox below:&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;(a)&lt;/b&gt; What is

        <question>What do the results you got indicate about the
        relationship between typical seating location in class and
        academic performance in college?</question>
        <our_answer>
          <text>The data suggest that GPA is somewhat related to
          seating location. In general, the GPAs of students who
          sit in the front of the classroom are slightly higher
          than those of students who sit in the middle or in the
          back. However, there is a lot of variation in GPA within
          each of the three groups, and therefore the student's
          typical seating location should not really be used as an
          indication of his/her performance in college.</text>

          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The conclusions support what we

          any differences in GPAs between students who sit in the
          middle of the classroom and those who sit in the
          back.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;If instructors were
          made aware of these results, they could encourage
          students who are doing poorly to change their seat
          location. Also, students should be made aware that where
          they sit might impact their
          performance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <text>In the first and third question, we examined two
        explanatory variables for the response variable college
        GPA. We found that generally, students who have a high high
        school GPA will tend to also have a high college GPA, and
        that students who typically sit in the front of the
        classroom generally have a higher GPA than those who sit in
        the middle or the back. In the second question, we
        investigated a completely unrelated issue, the differences
        in body image between males and females. We were surprised
        to find that actually a higher percentage of females were
        satisfied with their weight than males.</text>
