  <background>Low birth weight is an outcome that has been of
  concern to physicians for years. This is due to the fact that
  infant mortality rates and birth defect rates are very high for
  babies with low birth weight. A woman's behavior during pregnancy
  (including diet, smoking habits, and obtaining prenatal care) can
  greatly alter her chances of carrying the baby to term and,
  consequently, of delivering a baby of normal birth weight.
  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this exercise, we will use a 1986 study
  (Hosmer and Lemeshow (2000), &lt;i&gt;Applied Logistic
  Regression: Second Edition&lt;/i&gt;) in which data were
  collected from 189 women (of whom 59 had low birth weight
  infants) at the Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, MA (an
  academic, research, and teaching hospital that serves as the
  western campus of Tufts University School of Medicine and is the
  only Level 1 trauma center in western Massachusetts). The goal of
  the study was to identify risk factors associated with giving
  birth to a low birth weight baby.</background>

          <hint>In this dataset, each row represents a single
          mother, so the first ten rows represent the first ten
          patients. Look at the "Low" column and count how many of
          the first ten mothers gave birth to a baby whose weight
          was normal (coded as 0).</hint>
          <hint>If you look at the "Low" column, you'll see that
          eight of the first ten mothers gave birth to a baby whose
          weight was normal (coded as 0). These are mothers 1, 2,

          <hint>If you look at the BWT column, you'll find that the
          lowest birth weight among the first ten is 1818 grams,

        <question>What do the results indicate about the

        <our_answer>
          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In the exploratory data
          analysis, we saw some differences in the occurrence of
          low birth weight babies among mothers of different
          races.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The formal
          statistical test, however, produced a p-value of .082
          indicating that the data do not provide enough evidence
          to conclude that low birth weight is indeed related to
          race. In other words, even though the data showed some
          differences between the races, the evidence in not strong
          enough to conclude that race is a risk factor for low
          birth weight.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

    <text>Are there significant differences in age between mothers

      <consider_question>
        <question>Before analyzing the data and discovering whether
        there are significant age differences between low and

        will show (use your own experience and
        intuition).</question>
        <our_answer>
          <text>It is known that age is a risk factor for
          complications during pregnancy, where the older the
          mother, the more likely the occurrence. It would be
          reasonable to expect that the data will support that low
          birth weight may be one of the issues for older
          mothers.</text>

        some effect, but the data did not provide strong enough
        evidence to conclude that it is a risk factor. We also

        <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since this is an observational
        study, we cannot make any causal conclusions. However,
        identifying risk factors is an important finding regardless
        of whether these risk factors have a direct causal effect
        on low birth weight. It should be noted that we can never
        conduct a randomized experiment for factors such as
        smoking, race, or age. However, as long as we have a sample
        that accounts for the diversity in the population, the
        results are noteworthy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even
        though we are not specifically told this is a random
        sample, this was a major medical study conducted at a major
        research center. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that
        our sample accounts for the diversity in the population of
