  <background>It is very unlikely that two drivers who have the
  same auto insurance with the same insurance company will have the
  same monthly premium since there are many factors (other than the
  type of insurance) that are taken into account when the monthly
  premium is calculated. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this exercise we
  will explore some of those factors by analyzing data that were
  collected from a random sample of 50 drivers insured with a
  certain company and having similar auto insurance coverage. For
  each driver the monthly premium was recorded along with other
  relevant information such as gender, age, driving experience,
  history of auto accidents, model and age of the car. Note that
  the data set for this exercise contains only a subset of the
  variables.</background>

        <our_answer>
          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory data analysis
          suggests that as the driving experience increases the
          monthly premium decreases and that this negative
          relationship is moderately
          linear.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the p-value
          of the test is so small that it is reported to be
          essentially 0, we can conclude that these results are
          significant and that, indeed, there is a (moderate)
          linear relationship between monthly premium and driving
          experience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <question>What do the results you got indicate about
        whether gender has an effect on the monthly
        premium?</question>
        <our_answer>
          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The exploratory data analysis
          suggests that the premiums of male drivers are higher
          than the premiums of female
          drivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the p-value
          of the two-sample t-test is small (in particular, it is
          &amp;lt; .05) we can conclude that the data provide
          significant evidence that the mean monthly premium of
          males is higher than that of
          females.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are consistent with
          what we expected.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;We have
          seen that insurance companies use gender as a factor in
          deciding insurance premiums, but there is no practical
          use for this information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <text>We found that both gender and driving experience are
        factors in determining the monthly premium of auto
        insurance. In particular, the monthly premium for males is
        significantly higher than that for females, and the monthly
        premium generally decreases as the driver gains more
        experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It should be mentioned that
        there are other factors that affect the monthly premium
        that were not investigated in this exercise (for example:
        number of accidents and car model).</text>

        <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since this was an observational
        study we cannot make any causal
        conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Since the sample
        for this study was random, we certainly can generalize the
        results to the population of drivers with similar coverage
        from this insurance company. In addition, there is no
        reason to believe that the drivers insured by this company
        are systematically different from the drivers insured by
        other companies. Therefore, we would be safe in
        generalizing these results to all
        drivers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>
