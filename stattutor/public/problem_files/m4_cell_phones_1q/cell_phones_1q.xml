  <background>College students at a large state university
  completed a survey about their academic and personal life.
  Questions ranged from "How many credits are you registered for
  this semester?" to "Would you define yourself as a vegetarian?"
  Four sections of an introductory statistics course were chosen at
  random from all the sections of introductory statistics courses
  offered at the university in the semester when the survey was
  conducted, and the 312 students who completed the survey were
  students registered in one of the four chosen
  sections.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this exercise, we will use a
  subset of variables from the survey and use the collected data to
  answer three questions. Note that (1) these are real data, and
  (2) the symbol * in the worksheet means that this observation is
  not available (this is known as a "missing
  value").</background>

 <main_question>
    <text>Based on a recent study, roughly 80% of college students
    in the U.S. own a cell phone. Do the data provide evidence that
    the proportion of students who own cell phones in this
    university is lower than the national figure?</text>
    <reflect_on_question>
      <consider_question>
        <question>Before analyzing the data and exploring how cell
        phone ownership among college students at this university
        compares with college students in general, try to predict
        what the data will show (use your own experience and
        intuition).</question>
        <our_answer>
          <text>There is no reason to believe that students at this
          university are different from the entire population of
          students in the U.S. with respect to whether or not they
          own a cell phone.</text>

        <text>The three questions we answered in this exercise have
        to do with evaluating some characteristics of stats
        students at the university where the study was done
        relative to some other larger groups of students. We found
        that the mean verbal SAT score of the stats students is
        significantly different from that of the entire student
        body at the university, and that the proportion of stats
        students who own a cell phone is not significantly lower
        than the proportion for all college students in the nation.
        In addition we found that the mean number of sleep hours of
        stats students at this university is significantly
        different from that of U.S. adults.</text>

        <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The questions in this StatTutor
        only dealt with one variable rather than how one variable
        affected another. Thus, making causal conclusions is not
        appropriate.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;The cluster
        sampling design produces a random sample, and therefore we
        can generalize our results to the entire "population" of
        students at this university who are taking this stats
        class. Again, since stats students have many different
        majors, we can probably generalize the results to the
        entire student body at &lt;b&gt;this&lt;/b&gt;
        university.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>
