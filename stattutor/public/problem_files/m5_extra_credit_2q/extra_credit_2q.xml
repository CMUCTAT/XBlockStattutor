  <background>At the end of the semester, an "Introduction to
  Statistics" instructor wanted to gain insight into his students'
  performance by analyzing gradebook data. The instructor taught 3
  large lecture sections offered at different times during the day.
  Since each section, depending on the time it was taught,
  attracted different types of students (in terms of major, age,
  full-time/part-time, etc.) the instructor chose a random sample
  of 35 students from each section to insure proper representation.

          <hint>In this dataset, each row represents a single

          (coded as 1).</hint>
          <hint>If you look at the first ten students (rows) in the
          dataset, you'll see that six of the students submitted
          the extra credit assignment (Extra Credit=1). These are

          <our_answer>
            <text>No! Since this is an observational study, no
            causal conclusions can be made (recall that the only

            study is a randomized experiment). A possible
            explanation for the difference in the two groups of

        <question>According to the results you got, is the fact
        that the material covered by the second midterm is harder
        than the material covered by the first reflected by
        students' grades?</question>
        <our_answer>
          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though the material
          covered by the second exam is harder, the exploratory
          analysis does not provide any evidence indicating that
          students performed worse on the second
          exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;More formally, the
          paired t-test produced a p-value of .203 indicating that
          the data do not provide sufficient evidence to conclude
          that students did better on the first
          exam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

          <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The results are quite
          surprising. One explanation could be that in order to
          compensate for the fact that the material covered by the
          second exam is harder, the students spent more time
          studying for the exam, and therefore this is not
          reflected by the students'
          grades.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;Students need to
          know ahead of time that the material on the second exam
          is more challenging so they can plan their study time
          accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>

        <text>In this exercise we analyzed data from an
        instructor's gradebook. We found that performance on the
        final is significantly related to whether or not the
        student did an extra credit assignment as well as to the
        student's class. Also, we were surprised to find out that
        even though the material covered by the second midterm is
        harder than the material covered by the first midterm,
        there were no significant differences in performance
        between the two exams.</text>

        <text>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;As we discussed before, this is
        an observational study, so the instructor cannot make any
        causal conclusions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;li&gt;We can
        definitely generalize the results to the entire group of
        students who take Introductory Statistics with this
        instructor. Therefore, the results can be very informative
        to this instructor. However, it is not clear whether the
        results we got can be generalized to any larger group
        beyond this instructor's students. One could argue that the
        results we get for one instructor could be very different
        for another.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</text>
